#+title: SC OBC TRCH Firmware

  This is for SC-OBC A1001.  Do NOT use it for EM1.

* How to build and program
** Prerequisite
   #+begin_example
     $ xc8-cc --version
     Microchip MPLAB XC8 C Compiler V2.46
     Build date: Jan  4 2024
     Part Support Version: 2.46
     Copyright (C) 2024 Microchip Technology Inc.

     $ cd trch-firmware
     $ git describe
     release-v1.0-28-g7ec231d
   #+end_example

** Build
  You need GNU Make in addition to Microchip MPLAB XC8 Compiler to
  build it. We currently support v2.46.

** Program
   You need a Microchip MPLAB IPE and MPLAB PICkit4.  Make sure it
   works on your system and do the following.

   #+begin_example
     $ make program
   #+end_example

* Pins and Signals
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tDlF5Ewv5WGajEHtzYHvV77b9ePaPVuW5S8i3cOUTzY/edit?usp=sharing

  - Domain :: Whether a pin is strictly used by the system, or open to
    User, or reserved and not available to neither.  "User (Shared)"
    is basically for Users but because the signals are shared between
    TRCH and the FPGA, the system disables them by setting INPUT when
    the FPGA is active.
  - Categroy :: A name of a function which groups pins.
    - Control :: Pins used for controling the FPGA behaviour are
      categorized as "Control".
    - Diagnosis :: Pins which Users can use to diagnose the system
      when something goes wrong. Users can only read the pins level.
    - User :: Pins fully open for Users are in this category.
  - Pin Function :: Either pin is used as a GPIO or used for a function.
  - External Pull :: Whether a pin has a pull-up, a pull-down, or none.
    If a pull-up, it is either =VDD_3V3_SYS= or =VDD_3V3=.
  - States :: We have =INIT=, =POWER_DOWN=, =POWER_OFF=, =POWER_UP=,
    =READY=, =CONFIG=, =ACTIVE=, and =ERROR=.
    - INIT :: This is a special state.  This shows the first pin
      settings TRCH initializes to right after Power-on Reset.  This
      state is not defined in the state machine.  Please note that
      these pins are not guaranteed to stay with the initial values.
      Peripheral initialize functions in C will change to whatever it
      suites to.
    - POWER_DOWN :: The state to power down the FPGA.  You will be in
      this state after =FPGAPWR_EN= is deasserted and until =VDD_3V3=
      is at the GND level.  In ~fpga.h~, this corresponds to
      ~FPGA_STATE_POWER_DOWN~.
    - POWER_OFF :: The state to indicate that the FPGA is fully
      powered off and =VDD_3V3= is at the GND level.  This corresponds
      to ~FPGA_STATE_POWER_OFF~.
    - POWER_UP :: The state when the FPGA is powering up.  That is,
      from =FPGAPWR_EN= is asserted to =VDD_3V3= is fully up.
    - READY :: This indicates the FPGA is up and ready to be
      configured.  This corresponds to ~FPGA_STATE_READY~ in the state
      machine.
    - CONFIG :: While in this state, the FPGA is configuring. This
      represents ~FPGA_STATE_CONFIG~ in the source code.
    - ACTIVE :: The FPGA is configured and
      running. ~FPGA_STATE_ACTIVE~.
    - ERROR :: When TRCH find the watchdog live pulse does not come
      from the FPGA, you'll be in this state.
  - Dirs and Levels :: TRCH pins' directions and levels.
    - =In= :: The pin is INPUT.
    - =Out= :: The pin is OUTPUT.
    - =High= :: The pin is driving HIGH.
    - =LOW= :: The pin is driving LOW.
    - =X= :: Level can be either HIGH or LOW depending on the system or
      a User's request.
    - =-= :: Doesn't matter.  Usually indicates a Level when a pin is
      configured as INPUT.
